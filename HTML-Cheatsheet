      <h2>Learning HTML/CSS</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Learning HTML and CSS seems to be a practice in repetition. when I first started it felt clunky and annoying to write, but with practice, and a good text editor that allows me to tab-complete tags, I've become pretty fast. I work mainly with Python, but I'm hoping to learn how to build full-stacks using multiple languages, and tools. I'm excited to keep going.</p>
        <p>If you're here reading this, I appreciate you stopping by. If you're experienced you'll notice I've left quite a bit of powerful properties and tags out, this is purely because of my restrictive schedule, the goal of this page is to provide some content, but mainly to establish a baseline that can be built upon later, when I'm more experienced in other aspects of webapp development.</p>
