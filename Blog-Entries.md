## How Long Does it Take to Become a Certified Ethical Hacker?

Network security is at the pivotal point for any organization or business entity.
It involves protection of access, mismanagement, and hacking of a company’s’ crucial
files of a computer network system. Many organizations have employed a tool to check 
and test for their network security and one of them is ethical hacking.


This is an emerging tool that can be used to detect security vulnerability and risks
in an organization’s network. Businesses have decided to adopt ethical hacking tools 
to secure essential documents, sensitive information and to keep their network safe 
from malicious hackers. Most organizations often hire ethical hackers to perform security
measures on their behalf.


## General Information

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## The significance of ethical hacking
### The importance of ethical hacking in organizations includes:

Objective analysis of information security status of an organization. This is done through 
test entry points, scanning for weakness and priorities targets
Developing goal-oriented strategies that leverage a company’s security resources
Employ security assessments with actionable remediation insights tailored to the organization’s
unique IT environment, capabilities, and security objectives
Helping businesses prioritize their security resources. It does this by acquiring security 
tools; such as firewalls and IPS devices, check on their security efforts, security policiesadjustments.
Enhances a more mainstream service
Improves effective verification of the enterprise security architecture
Helps in prevention and detection of cyber terrorism
How do you become an ethical hacker?
Due to the increased cases of network insecurities, businesses and organizations are trying to 
come up with ways to keep their networks safer. This has coerced organizations to employ ethical
hackers who will help in keeping their network security in check.

#### The job market is up-and-coming for ethical hackers because the information technology industry 
is rapidly growing regardless of the economic problems. Before you become an ethical hacker, you 
should consider the following;

The level you’re in the IT field
Programming and networking skills
Personal attributes- patience, perseverance, and persistence
Simple steps involved for one to become an ethical hacker
Take your time and learn the basics of computer networking - This consists in discovering a number
of both old and new programming languages including Java, PHP, C, Perl, and Python. You also required
to know markup-based languages including HTML. You should even master operating systems such as UNIX
which is aimed at proving a high level of security.
Master the fundamentals of cybersecurity- Learn networking concepts by having a clear understanding of
TCP/IP and UDP protocols.
Gaining knowledge in Cryptography- 
Being critical in network security, learning it is essential in
cybersecurity. It involves mathematical logarithms which will enable you to be able to see weaknesses
or security breaches with ease.
Training- Once you have all the above basics, you need to put the knowledge into actions by practicing
and performing and to always get yourself updated in matters network security.
What you should know about ethical hacking
Know about both the merits and demerits of various types of hackers including Grey Hat, White Hat, and
Black Hat hackers in order not to be on the wrong side of the law.
Find out the job opportunities for ethical hackers which will help you practice more
Try to analyze the basic requirements or the areas that you need to work on
Think about specialization that is, whether you are best suited in software or hardware for you to be 
able to perfect on that specialize area and give it your best
You need to ensure beside the basic knowledge you have acquired; you need to take a professional course
that will expand your knowledge in ethical hacking
Experiment with both software and hardware of different machines to learn how to handle every situation 
differently if there is any attempt from a malicious hacker
Strive to get certification by acquiring certified ethical hacker certification since it will help you 
succeed in IT field.
You should not forget to read tutorials to increase your understanding of ethical hacking
How long it takes to learn ethical hacking
Would you like to train your employees about ethical hacking?

DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. 
It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. 
Most prominently, it translates domain names meaningful for users to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating computer services and devices worldwide.
By providing a worldwide, distributed keyword-based redirection service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet.
Open up the command prompt (In Windows, you can use WINDOWS KEY+R to open Run dialogue box and type cmd)

(note: Use your up and down arrow keys to access recent commands you have entered in the command line.)

To see your current DNS settings, type ipconfig /displaydns and press Enter.

To delete the entries, type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.

To see your DNS settings again, type ipconfig /displaydns and press Enter.

You should see blank records or you might get the message "Could not display the DNS Resolver Cache."

To perform a DNS lookup, type ping scisweb.ulster.ac.uk and press Enter.

To see your DNS settings again, type ipconfig /displaydns and press Enter.

You should see a DNS record for scisweb.ulster.ac.uk that includes the IP address and other information. Another field in the DNS cache is a TTL value, which is different from the TTL in an IP packet. 
This DNS TTL value is sent by the DNS server maintaining the scisweb.ulster.ac.uk record. 
It is measured in seconds and tells your DNS client how long to cache the DNS record as a safeguard against clients holding on to DNS records whose IP addresses might have changed.
To open your computer’s Hosts file, run Notepad as administrator. 
Easiest way is to press and then type notepad in windows 8 splashscreen, select notepad and right click and then select "Run as administrator" in bottom taskbar area of windows 8. 
In the Open dialog box, navigate to C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc. In the File type drop-down list, click All Files. Double-click the hosts file to open it.

You should now have a hosts file open with various settings.

After the last line in the file, type 193.61.191.104 university, and then save the file and exit Notepad.

At the command prompt, type ipconfig /displaydns and press Enter to see that the entry is in your DNS cache.

Type ping university and press Enter.

Delete the DNS cache again by typing ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.

Display your DNS cache by typing ipconfig /displaydns and press Enter.

Notice that the university entry remains in the cache because the Hosts file data always stays in the cache.

Type nslookup scisweb.ulster.ac.uk and press Enter.

Your DNS server’s name and IP address are displayed, along with the name and IP address of www.ulster.ac.uk. You use Nslookup to look up a host’s IP address without actually communicating with it.

Type nslookup and press Enter.

You should now have entered Nslookup’s interactive mode. You should see an arrow prompt.

Type www.google.com and press Enter.

Notice that more than one address is returned along with one or more aliases (other names that www.google.com goes by).

Type www.google.com again (or press the up arrow to repeat the last line you typed) and press Enter.

You should see the IP addresses returned in a different order. (If you don’t, keep trying, and the order will change.)

The www.google.com page can be reached by a number of different IP addresses, and the addresses are returned in a different order so that a different server is used each time, which is called load balancing.

Nslookup is also used to do reverse lookups, in which the IP address is given and the hostname is returned.

If you are ever concerned that your DNS server is not working correctly, you can test it with Nslookup and compare the results of your DNS server with the results from another server, such as Google's.
