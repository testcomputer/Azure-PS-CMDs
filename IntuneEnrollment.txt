To enroll a device in a management solution such as Microsoft Intune using a USB drive, 
you will need to first create a provisioning package on the device you want to enroll. 
This package will contain the necessary information and settings to enroll the device, 
such as the enrollment URL, policies, and credentials.

Once the provisioning package has been created, you can use a USB drive to transfer it 
to the device that you want to enroll. To do this, follow these steps:

    Insert the USB drive into the device you want to enroll.

    Navigate to the location where the provisioning package was saved and copy it to the USB drive.

    Remove the USB drive from the device and insert it into the device that you want to enroll.

    On the target device, navigate to the location where the provisioning package is stored on 
    the USB drive and double-click on it to begin the enrollment process.

    Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the enrollment process. This may involve entering 
    credentials, selecting policies, and agreeing to terms and conditions.

Once the enrollment process is complete, the device will be enrolled in the management solution 
and will receive the specified policies and settings. Keep in mind that the exact steps for 
enrolling a device using a USB drive may vary depending on the specific device and management 
solution that you are using. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the documentation 
provided by the manufacturer or vendor.
