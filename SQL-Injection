Example 1
In SQL: select id, firstname, lastname from authors

If one provided: Firstname: evil'ex and Lastname: Newman

the query string becomes:

select id, firstname, lastname from authors where firstname = 'evil'ex' and lastname ='newman'

which the database attempts to run as:

Incorrect syntax near il' as the database tried to execute evil.

A safe version of the above SQL statement could be coded in Java as:

String firstname = req.getParameter("firstname");
String lastname = req.getParameter("lastname");
// FIXME: do your own validation to detect attacks
String query = "SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM authors WHERE firstname = ? and lastname = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement( query );
pstmt.setString( 1, firstname );
pstmt.setString( 2, lastname );
try
{
    ResultSet results = pstmt.execute( );
}
